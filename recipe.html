<ul>
<li>1 cup (2 sticks) Cannabis Butter <em>or ¾ cup canna butter and 1¼ unsalted for low tolerance</em></li>

<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

<li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

<li>1 cup(packed) dark brown sugar</li>

<li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>

<li>2  large eggs, room temperature</li>

<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

<hr>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>
    Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, <strong>stirring often,</strong> until it foams, then browns, <em>takes about 5–8 minutes.</em> Scrape into a large <strong>heat safe</strong> bowl and let cool slightly, until cool enough to touch (like the temperature of a warm bath), <em>takes about about 10 minutes.</em></li> 
    <br>
    <li> Meanwhile, whisk <em>sifted</em> flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <br>
   <li>Add brown sugar and granulated sugar to browned butter. Beat until incorporated. Add eggs and vanilla, increase and beat until mixture and begins to thicken. Slowly add dry ingredients. Beat just to combine. Mix in toffee pieces and chocolate. Let dough sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes <em>for best results let rest for 1 to 2 days</em> Dough will thicken as it sits.</li> 
   <br>
    
    <li> When ready, to cook Preheat to 375°. Using a 1-oz. ice cream scoop <em>or spoon</em> portion out balls of dough and place on a buttered <em>(of your choice)</em>baking sheet, spacing about 3" apart (you can also form dough into ping pong–sized balls with your hands). Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
    <br>
   <li>
    Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but centers are still soft, 9–11 minutes. Let cool.</li>
